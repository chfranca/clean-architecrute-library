## `Clean Architecture Library`

In my attempt to understand the clean architecture concept, I'm implementing a simple
library system, separating into: 
- **Core**: Which is in the domain folder, where it contains the core business
  rules
- **Infrastructure**: Which is the infra folder, where it implements the adapters for tools 
  like databases, and other libraries
- **Application**: Where all the use cases are implemented

As long as I keep studying and learning more, I'll update the project
